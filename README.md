``` Build Stuff And Break Stuff ```

 I'm a computer science and engineering undergrad who is passionate about coding and building things through code. I mostly work with Python, C and C++ and also HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on small scale projects and would love to collaborate on new projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js
- 🐧 I spend most of my free time tinkering with my [Arch Linux setup](https://github.com/Pseudozoid/linux-configs)
