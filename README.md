``` Build Stuff And Break Stuff ```

 I'm a computer science and engineering student who likes to code and start projects that never get finished.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on small scale projects and would love to collaborate on new projects
- 🪴 I’m currently learning to be human
- 🐧 I spend most of my free time tinkering with my [Arch Linux setup](https://github.com/Pseudozoid/linux-configs)
